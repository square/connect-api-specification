Connect v2 API Specifications
=============================

This repository contains the specifications for generating client SDKs with
[Swagger/OpenAPI](http://swagger.io/).

The canonical specification is defined in `api.json`. The templates for our
supported SDKs are located in `swagger-templates`. The configuration for each
SDK (e.g. name of the library, version number, etc.) are located in
`swagger-configs`.

To generate an SDK the way we generate them, simply run `make`. You will need
[Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for this to
work, but the script will prompt you to install it.

Currently, we officially support
[Ruby](https://github.com/square/connect-ruby-sdk) and
[PHP](https://github.com/square/connect-php-sdk).
[Python](https://github.com/square/connect-python-sdk).
