# Square Connect V2 C# SDK

This repository contains the released C# client SDK. Check out our [API
specification repository](https://github.com/square/connect-api-specification)
for the specification and template files we used to generate this.

## Frameworks supported
{{^supportUWP}}
- .NET 4.0 or later
- Windows Phone 7.1 (Mango)
{{/supportUWP}}
{{#supportUWP}}
- UWP
{{/supportUWP}}

## Dependencies
- [RestSharp] (https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp) - 105.1.0 or later
- [Json.NET] (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) - 7.0.0 or later

The DLLs included in the package may not be the latest version. We recommned using [NuGet] (https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget) to obtain the latest version of the packages:
```
Install-Package RestSharp
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
```

NOTE: RestSharp versions greater than 105.1.0 have a bug which causes file uploads to fail. See [RestSharp#742](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/742)

## Generating DLLs
Option 1: Run the following command to generate the DLL

- [Mac/Linux] `/bin/sh build.sh`
- [Windows] `build.bat`

Option 2: Import the `Square.Connect/Square.Connect.csproj` to your solution and build from VS

## Usage
Then include the DLLs (under the `bin` folder) in the C# project, 

- RestSharp.dll
- Newtonsoft.Json.dll
- Square.Connect.dll

And use the namespaces:
```csharp
using Square.Connect.Api;
using Square.Connect.Client;
using Square.Connect.Model;
```

## Getting Started

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using {{packageName}}.Api;
using {{packageName}}.Client;
using {{packageName}}.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class Example
    {
        // Retriveing your location IDs
        public static void RetriveLocations()
        {
            LocationApi _locationApi = new LocationApi();
            string authorization = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
            var response = _locationApi.ListLocations(authorization);
        }

        // Charge the card nonce
        public static void ChargeNonce()
        {
            // Every payment you process for a given business have a unique idempotency key.
            // If you're unsure whether a particular payment succeeded, you can reattempt
            // it with the same idempotency key without worrying about double charging
            // the buyer.
            string idempotencyKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

            // Monetary amounts are specified in the smallest unit of the applicable currency.
            // This amount is in cents. It's also hard-coded for $1, which is not very useful.
            int amount = 100;
            string currency = "USD";
            Money money = new Money(amount, Money.ToCurrencyEnum(currency));

            string nonce = "YOUR_NONCE";
            string authorization = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
            string locationId = "YOUR_LOCATION_ID";
            ChargeRequest body = new ChargeRequest(AmountMoney: money, IdempotencyKey: idempotencyKey, CardNonce: nonce);
            TransactionApi transactionApi = new TransactionApi();
            var response = transactionApi.Charge(authorization, locationId, body);
        }
    }
}
```
